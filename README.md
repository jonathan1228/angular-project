### App Description
===================

This project will be heavily involving Angular JS, as well as the Twitter API and a chart map of the United States from [LeafletJS](http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth.html). This app will closely follow the 2016 Presidential Campaigns of each presidential runners, specifically on their Twitter social-network. We will be including in this project: a database to store Local-Auth username and password; using the external database of Twitter's API to populate the chart; and will populate the chart with the talked about presidential runners in each state. This might be a problem if Tweets were not geo-tagged or if there isn't any data regarding a presidential runner.
